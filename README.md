# Insurance-Infographic-Project

Web application tool, where I was given the task of form generation and visualisation of data sourced from a Insurance database.
The user is prompted to select a Insurance Heatmap through a form, and then varying form filters taken from the database are generated.
Based off the user inputs, details and prices associated with user inputs are displayed through a table or graph
HTML, JavaScript and JQuery were used as the front-end language, and PHP + SQL was used as backend.
